This guide demonstrates how to generate dynamic documentation from cloud infrastructure using Ansible automation.

*Estimated time to complete: 15 minutes*

---

== Lab Overview

Welcome to the third challenge. In this lab, you will generate a dynamic HTML website using the structured data gathered in the previous challenge.

First, log in to the Ansible Automation Platform UI with the following credentials.

.Login Credentials
[cols="1,2a"]
|===
| Username | `admin`
| Password | `ansible123!`
|===

== Task 1: Create a New Job Template

You will start by creating a job template that runs a playbook to generate the cloud report.

. **Navigate to the Templates page.**
+
From the left navigation menu, select *Templates*.

. **Initiate the creation of a new job template.**
+
Click the **Create template** button, then select **Create job template**.
+

. **Enter the job template details.**
+
Fill out the form with the following information:
+
[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Parameter | Value
| Name | `Create Cloud Report`
| Job Type | `Run`
| Inventory | `Demo Inventory`
| Project | `AWS Demos Project`
| Execution Environment | `AWS Execution Environment`
| Playbook | `playbooks/cloud_report.yml`
| Credentials | `AWS_Credential` and `SSH Controller Credential`
|===
+
IMPORTANT: This job template requires two credentials. One is for retrieving information from AWS, and the second is for connecting via SSH to the report server to generate the report.

. **Save the job template.**
+
Click the blue **Save** button.

---

== Task 2: Add a Survey

Next, you will add a survey to allow the user to specify which server will host the generated HTML report.

. **Open the job template's settings.**
+
Navigate to the *Templates* page and click on the name of the `Create Cloud Report` job template.

. **Navigate to the Survey tab.**
+
At the top of the template's details page, click the **Survey** tab.
+

. **Create a new survey question.**
+
Click the blue **Add** button.

. **Configure the survey question.**
+
Fill out the form with the following values:
+
[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Parameter | Value
| Question | `Which server do you want to host the report?`
| Answer variable name | `_hosts`
| Answer type | `Text`
| Default answer | `ansible-1`
|===

. **Save the survey question.**
+
Click the blue **Save** button.

. **Enable the survey.**
+
Make sure to click the toggle switch to enable the survey.
+

+
NOTE: For this lab, we will host the report on the `ansible-1` host. However, this survey demonstrates how you can make the destination configurable, allowing you to host dynamic documentation anywhere, including on services like Amazon S3.

---

== Task 3: Launch the Job Template

Now you are ready to run the job and generate the report.

. **Launch the job template.**
+
From the *Templates* page, find the `Create Cloud Report` template and click the **Launch** icon (ðŸš€).
+

. **Complete the survey.**
+
When prompted by the survey, accept the default host (`ansible-1`) and launch the job.

. **Review the playbook execution.**
+
This playbook uses two roles:
+
. The first role, `retrieve_info`, gathers structured data for VPCs, EC2 instances, and IGWs. link:https://github.com/ansible-cloud/aws_demos/tree/master/roles/retrieve_info[View source code].
. The second role, `build_report`, installs a web server, copies assets (CSS, images), and uses the structured data to generate an HTML report. link:https://github.com/ansible-cloud/aws_demos/tree/master/roles/build_report[View source code].

. **View the generated report.**
+
Once the job completes, navigate to the **Dynamic Report** tab in your lab window. You may need to refresh the page (âŸ³). Click on the gray boxes with the caret (â–¸) to expand the tables.
+
The report will look similar to this:

== Task 4: Compare Regions

A cloud operator can use this report to gain quick awareness of their cloud footprint across different regions. This helps answer important questions, such as:

* How can I identify unused VPCs that can be safely deleted?
* Which regions are actively running instances?
* Which regions contain stopped instances that could be restarted?

This automated report provides a powerful tool for resource management and cost optimization.
